# Amazon Apparel Recommendation
In this recommendation system project, I have shown how text based and visual features based similarities help us recommend similar products to the end customers. In this project, I have used BOW, TFIDF, W2V, Tensorflow libraries like keras and Tensorflow to get the similarity values based on various features and also tried some tweeks like doing weighted similarity on some features like brand and color, becuase it is seen most often that people prefer to check apparels of either same brand or same color when browsing through thousands of options.
